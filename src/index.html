        <p>the DOM is an abstraction of structured text. It's a specific instance of any given HTML code that can be altered dynamically without changing the underlying code.</p>
        <p>Elements in the HTML are considered 'nodes' of the DOM. The problem with the standard DOM is that for websites that load large amounts of objects (e.g. twitter, pinterest), the DOM then has too many nodes, which makes it difficult to interact with efficiently.</p>

        <p>Any method in a <a href="#classbasedcomponents">class-based component</a> is called, it must be bound using the bind method (usually in the constructor) or it will prompt an "uncaught TypeError".</p>
        <h3><a name="minify" class="landing">Minfy</a></h3>

        <h3>Props</h3>
        <p>These are properties that are accepted by react components as a special type of argument.</p>
        <p>In <a href="#classbasedcomponents">class-based components</a>, props can only be accessed by calling <span class="code">this.props.propName</span> instead of <span class="code">props.propName</span> like functional components.</p>

            <p>How does the process of making a Git commit differ when working in pairs, versus when working independently?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <ul>
              <li>the command is different <span class="code">git commit</span> vs <span class="code">git pair</span></li>
              <li>the pair file can be opened and edited in atom, the single user git can be revised using <span class="code">git config --global user.name 'your name'</span> and <span class="code">git config --global user.email 'your email'</span></li>

          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>It pushes to the master remote branch on Github as opposed to a different branch</p>

            <p>What is the difference between the local .git repository, and the repository created on Github?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>the local git repository is the one you are revising when you're writing code, whereas the Github repository only stores changes when you push to it. Github repositories are available whenever you are connected to the internet and a local copy is only available to the machine you're working on.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p>How are the local .git repository, and the repository created on Github 'connected'?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>They are connected when you <span class="code">remote add</span> your repository. They are technically the same document but the remote repository needs to be periodically pushed to.</p>

            <p>What benefit is there to ensuring it's consistent?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>so that things like opening or closing braces can be found quickly (as they are fairly common errors) and generally to write code faster.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question">
            <p>When do we indent?</p>
          </div>

          <div class="question">
            <p>Why does indentation and spacing matter?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
